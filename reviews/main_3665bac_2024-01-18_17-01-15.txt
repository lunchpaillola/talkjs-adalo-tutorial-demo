Review:
Potential issues, bugs, or flaws:
- It seems like a lot of properties have been removed from the manifest file without much context. It's important to understand the rationale behind these removals and ensure that they are intentional. If these properties are no longer needed, it would be important to document the reason for their removal in a comment for future reference.

Code suggestions, improvements:
- Consider providing a brief explanation in a comment for the changes made in the manifest file to increase the maintainability and readability of the codebase.
- It would be beneficial to maintain a version control history that clearly documents changes made to the manifest file to ensure transparency and easy identification of when and why changes occur.
